# MenuSkeleton
iOS slide over menu skeleton.

## What's this?
Many of our apps are using some sort of slide menu, aka the hamburger menu or Facebook menu. Up to iOS 7 we used [ViewDeck](https://github.com/Inferis/ViewDeck) exclusively but are now transitioning to [REFrostedViewController](https://github.com/romaonthego/REFrostedViewController).

Our previous code pattern to deal with the menu and changing the content controller needed some updating, not only because of the new library we're using but also to make the code more modern, readable and extensible with better memory management.

This repository is our skeleton for apps using REFrostedViewController, but the same code pattern can be used for other menu systems as well.
